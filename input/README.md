# Import Data to TensorFlow

This is a tutorial on importing data to TensorFlow.

## Introduction

Generally, there are four approaches to import data to TensorFlow Program:

1. using the Datasets API,
2. feeding,
3. reading from files,
4. preloaded data.

Some of these approach are more suitable for small datasets, while others may
be designed for large machine learning problems with distributed files.

## Using the Datasets API

Input pipeline is a mechanism to build a sequence of elements, for example,
in image recognition problems, each element is a bundle of a training sample
and its corresponding label.
